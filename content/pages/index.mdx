> [!NOTE]
> This extension does not contain any ads and does not modify web pages automatically.
> Any changes and modifications on the sites are done by installed scripts.
> Therefore, please install only scripts that you trust.

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is **no longer supported on Chrome** due to its Manifest V2 architecture. While a Manifest V3 rewrite might be considered in the future, it is not planned for the foreseeable future due to the considerable effort involved and the potential for losing existing features.
>
